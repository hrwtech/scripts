# How to think like a Pythonista

_Captured: 2015-10-26 at 18:19 from [python.net](http://python.net/crew/mwh/hacks/objectthink.html)_

This is an archive of part of a thread on comp.lang.python, kept here so I can post links to it when it seems appropriate (it dealt with a question that comes up relatively often).

If you want you can read the thread [on google](http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&threadm=3CBD1C02.8AB2CF62%40yahoo.com&rnum=1) instead.

In the recent past (this is being written in April 2002, for reference), a searcher after enlightenment posted the following query to [comp.lang.python](news:comp.lang.python):

Almost needless to say, it was the poster's intuition that was at fault, but he is (was) far from unique in having this sort of misconception.

Luckily for him, two more Pythonically experienced posters -- myself and Alex Martelli -- were in a particularly pedagogical mood that dayÂ¹, and wrote lengthy articles explaining in rather different ways where he was going wrong.

I ranted about thinking in terms of "names, objects and bindings", something I don't do enough, and drew some ascii art diagrams explaining what was going on under the covers of the interactive sessions the OP was confused about:

My access to email returned not long after posting, so my time wasting became more normal again. I might redraw the diagrams in [dia](http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/) or something someday (although probably only if my email goes down again...).

Alex took a different, wordier strategy, explaining that Python doesn't copy when it doesn't have to, recounting a very nice anecdote about a statue in Bologna and suggesting that the OP read some Borges, Calvino, Wittgenstein or Korzibsky:

The essay by /F that Alex was referring to was probably [this one](http://effbot.org/guides/python-objects.htm) (and even if it wasn't, you should still read it). It talks about some of the same issues in a terser style.

And just to prove that there is some point in all this, the OP went away a satisfied customer:

I hope you found these answers useful too.

Â¹ Well, he was lucky to catch me in such a mood. Alex writes articles like this all the time.
