# Roll your own AirDrop with Pythonista

It's always fun when two, seemingly unrelated topics, slowly merge together to give me a new idea. The first one I've been working on for some time has been a simpler way to quickly share code snippets between my Mac and my iPad. Yes, I know that's what Dropbox is for, but I wanted something with less overhead for quick a cut/copy/paste workflow. So when Apple discussed the idea of AirDrop a lot of people thought it sounded too good to be true. Now that Mavericks and iOS 7 have shipped, it appears the pundits were right.

So while this was rattling through my head, I read [a post by Ole Zorn](http://olemoritz.net/custom-homescreen-icons-with-pythonista.html) on how he could use Pythonista to run a local web server, [using SimpleHTTPServer](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/docs/library/simplehttpserver.html#module-SimpleHTTPServer), to install short cuts on an iOS device. Go ahead and read his postâ€¦ I can wait.

So after seeing Ole's post, I started to play around with the ` SimpleHTTPServer` module and put this together:
    
    
    import SimpleHTTPServer
    import SocketServer
    import webbrowser
    
    PORT = 8000
    
    Handler = SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
    
    httpd = SocketServer.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler)
    
    print "serving at port", PORT
    httpd.serve_forever()

Running this script in Pythonista on my iPad will turn the it into a mini web server.

Taking a peak at my iPad IP address (192.168.1.127), I go over to my Mac and open the URL `<http://192.168.1.127:8000>` and I see the following:

When the script is run in Pythonista, it treats the folder the script was started from as the root folder of the web server. So what I end up seeing is a list of the files in my Pythonista app. Here I can open one of the files, cut/copy portions of a script, and save it on my Mac. The iPad can even serve up proper HTML:

Now using the same concept, I can reverse the process and run a mini web server on my Mac to get files onto my iOS device. Open Terminal and go to the folder you want to share and run the following command:
    
    
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
    

This basically tells Python to load the `SimpleHTTPServer` module as a script, passing the value `8000` as a parameter. Now open Safari, enter the URL `<http://127.0.0.1:8000>`, and you get the following:

Since the script was run from the `boxdrop` folder, it treats the `boxdrop` folder as the root folder for the web server. So in the Finder window you can see there are four files:

  * date_time.py
  * GTD & OmniFocus Guide.pdf
  * IMG_0010-1.png
  * REFX - Clear Websphere Cache.md

Now open Safari on my iPad and I can see the list includes the four files and the typically hidden `.DS_Store` file.

So now if there is a code snippet on my iPad that I want to pull back to my Mac, I just run a modified version of the previous web server script. I use this one because now I can see what my IP address is inside of Pythonista.
    
    
    import SimpleHTTPServer
    import SocketServer
    import webbrowser
    import socket
    
    ip_addr = socket.gethostbyaddr(socket.getfqdn())[2]
    
    port = 8000
    
    Handler = SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
    
    httpd = SocketServer.TCPServer(("", port), Handler)
    
    print "Serving on IP address: ", ip_addr
    print "Serving on port: ", port
    httpd.serve_forever()

From here I could use Ole's short cut technique and put this script as a short cut on my iPad.

> So where does this get me?

Frankly I'm not sure. While these _hacks_ allow for the simple snippet sharing I was looking for, there feels like there is quite a bit of potential still untapped. I'm hoping this opens the door to others to explore and develop more elegant tools.
