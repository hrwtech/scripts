Whenever I need to quickly spin up a web application, Python's [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) library is my go to tool. Recently, however, I found myself wanting to generate a static HTML page to upload to S3 and wondered if I could use it for that as well.

It's actually not too tricky. If we're in [the scope of the app context](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31830663/how-to-render-template-in-flask-without-using-request-context) then we have access to the template rendering that we'd normally use when serving the response to a web request.

The following code will generate an HTML file based on a template file templates/blog.html:

templates/index.html

If we execute the Python script it will generate the following HTML:

And we can finish off by redirecting that output into a file:

We could also write to the file from Python, but this seems just as easy!
