The programming languages that developers use to create software are as varied and dynamic and spoken language. New languages crop up and existing ones evolve over time and borrow from one another.

The fluid and organic nature of coding languages can make it difficult to pin down exactly which skills are most marketable. Demand also changes from city to city.

A new study from Bellevue-based programming bootcamp[ Coding Dojo](http://www.codingdojo.com/) aims to bring some clarity to the issue. Coding Dojo added up the number of job postings mentioning each coding language from sites like Indeed.com and Dice.com, the average monthly Google search volume for coding language keywords, and asked instructors about student demand for each language. The bootcamp compiled the results in a list ranking each language by city.

"This analysis shows that the demand for coding skills is local, and knowing a language that will help you get a job in San Jose may not get you hired in Washington D.C.," Coding Dojo CEO Michael Choi said in a press release.

Below is Coding Dojo's ranking of each coding language by city. Next to each city's name is the company with the most job listings for the top language in that region.
