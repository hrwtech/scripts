# Workflow: * In _Working Copy_ open a GitHub repository that you want copied into _Pythonista_ * if your needs are more modest, you can even select a single file or folder * Click the Share icon at the upper right corner of the Working Copy screen * Click Run Pythonista Script * Click on this script * Click the run button

# When you [return to Pythonista](pythonista://) your files should be in the 'from Working Copy' directory.

## Pythonista --> Working Copy: Working Copy has a "__save to Working Copy__" Share Sheet action (you might have to enable in Share Sheet, More...)

# Workflow A -- a single file: * Open the file of interest in the Pythonista editor * Click the wrench icon at the upper right * Click the "Share..." button * Click "Save in Working Copy" button * Select the repo that you want to save the file into * Click "Save As..." * Change the filename if you want to and click "Save As..." again * Click "Just Save" if you want to bundle multiple files into a single commit --or-- Type your commit message and click "Commit"

# Workflow B -- a folder or a file: * Click `Edit` in the Pythonista file browser * Select the folder or file of interest * Click the Share icon at the bottom of the file browser * Click "Save in Working Copy" button * Select "Import as Repository" or "Save as Directory"

# Note: When selecting multiple folders or multiple files, only the first one is processed.

# __Now we have an end to end workflow: GitHub --> Working Copy --> Pythonista --> Working Copy --> GitHub__
