Cloud Jump 2 (WIP)
================

Expanding on [BashedCrab][]'s original [Cloud Jump][].

Special thanks to [cclauss][], [jsbain][], and [SebastianJarsve] [] for their contributions. 

Additional completed features so far:
------
* Sound Effects played in Threads when the Player:
	* Bounces off a cloud
	* Is killed
	* Gets a new high score
* Play in Portrait or Landscape Mode
* Player's High Score is saved
	* Player's name is also saved, and only needs to be entered by the player once.
* Monsters!  Be careful, you can use the same cloud as a monster but don't land on one!!
* Program uses sprites instead of images
	* Sprites greatly simplify updating and drawing code by moving to scene.Layers.

See the [repo's issue page][] to find out what is currently being worked on and what will be implemented next.
