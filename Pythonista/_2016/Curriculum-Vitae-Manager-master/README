Feel free to use this but I did create that site - http://www.curriculumvitae.co.za/

------------------
Wanted to be able to generate a good looking CV dynamic from a XML file. So I can just update the XML file and the script would output the CV in a PDF format. 

What I still want to do:
-> Generate a .doc word file from the xml file
-> Fix the Pages on PDF as some of them break the layout (Go over to the next page)
-> Accounts Sections (Where you point to all your accounts like github/stackoverflow/facebook/google plus etc.)
-> Add more details

Requirements:
-> PySide (http://www.pyside.org/)

Using the Script:
The script can be run by supplying the data xml file and the output file.

If the output file is a html file the script will output a single .html file.
Else if the output filename has .pdf extension or does not match any of the other the script will produce a .pdf using WebKit. (Black Magic huh :D)

The Command syntax:

python cv.py example.xml CV.pdf
or
python cv.py example.xml CV.html

Used:
-> PySide (http://www.pyside.org/)
-> Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)

Enjoy, this is one of my little side projects so I work on it when I have time. Could use your help if you have a idea.
