APDOS would never had existed without LOIC
(Low Orbit Ion Cannon).The funny idea of an off-topic 
loading screen for a DDoS/DoS client originates from LOIC.

     -+--=:=- Disclaimers -=:=--+-
Use APDOS at your own risk (even though it 
is perpously not powerful), DDoS/DoS attacks are 
illegal in most countries. For protection I recommend 
the use of a VPN (Virtual Private Network) at all times!
We the creators are not responsible for your choices or actions. 

I do not claim full credit for the original creation of the base 
functionality of this client. I used scripts as a base to start 
and "modded" them [Legally] so it could function neatly as a whole 
with the other scripts. I will give this time to mention the creators 
of the base coding.

So thank you to all the creators who help make this script possible!

      -+--=:=- Use / Edits -=:=--+-
APDOS intended use is to NON-MALISOUSLY attempt
Denial of Service on small servers as a stress test. 
(And by stating this it becomes legal to publish)

The intended program for this to run on is Pythonista 3 (c) 
from the AppSore; provided by Omz:Software (c) 2016. Not extended modules 
are required to run this version.

I hereby grant allowance to all who use this program, with the following:
-Allowed to change the script
-Allowed to alter use
-Allowed to republish if a significate amount of changes 
are applied to help improve or add to the functionality of the script as a whole
-Allowed to use (at their own risk)

I do NOT grant:
-Claiming ownership of the base script and current script
-DDoS-ing me with it
-DDoS-ing Toaster Ovens that do not belong to you

Enjoy the client. New versions will be added soon!
